It's a long story.

* 1. Very random.
  - There are 3 versions of this song, minimum.
  - Deep weird emotion.
  - I Me Mine evokes similar emotion, though slightly more cheerful.
* 2. Insanely popular. Appears on "Best Beatles Songs"
* 3. Obscure version of famous song. 

*** TODO: Consider Remastered 2009 and Remastered 2015 a single recording.
