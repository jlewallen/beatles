* 1. Very random.

  - Not on Revolver
  - Not on White
  - There are 3 versions of this song, minimum.
  - Deep weird emotion.
  - Similar style to I Me Mine, slightly more cheerful.
  - Puts it on and "floats"
  - Interesting lyrics, debate over meaning and interpreting.
  - Newer song.
  - Songs with talking/discussions about the music.
  - Ringo Talks
  - Not overproduced. Raw.
  - I Me Mine is frustration. Drama.
  - Note: "They are all in different albums anyways." So this means we can eliminate Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as that's where A Day In The Life is.

       +I think this is the one. The only thing is the lyrics don't have as much
       debate as I expected. I'm hoping the debate over who the fool actually is
       turns out to be enough.+

**** Considerations
***** Seth Convo

      - +She Loves You+ (No Ringo talking)
      - +The Night Before+ (Too few recordings)
      - +Yellow Submarine+ (Ringo talks, not very stylisticly like I Me Mine)
      - +Things We Said Today+ (Not very stylisticly like I Me Mine)
      - +Helter Skelter+ (White Album)
      - I've Got A Feeling
      - Two Of Us
      - +Golden Slumbers+
      - +Sun King+
      - It's Only Love
      - Girl

      - She's Leaving Home, [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/shes-leaving-home/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-shes-leaving-home-lyrics][Genius,]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She%27s_Leaving_Home][Wikipedia]]

        Kind of a dark vibe, not totally though. Not sure how interesting the lyrics are, though. Not like I Me Mine enough I don't think.

* 2. ✓ A Day In The Life

  [[https://open.spotify.com/user/jlewalle/playlist/1n119hyulDCJ5qzIObsWf9?si=3rbDltpZS8SGDAzV4TdUxQ][Spotify]]

 - Insanely Popular.
 - Would appear on any "Best Beatles Songs"
 - Is a masterpiece.
 - Meloncholic moments and then walks through different feelings.
 - Story behind the song solidified the favorite position.
 - A song that demonstrated how well ahead of their time they were.
 - Very early discovery.
 - Best of Ringo, subtle and perfect.

       My favorite so far. Obviously very influential and demonstrates their pioneering. Very famous and *some* emotional diversity, lyrically. I think the majority of the emotional range comes from the music, which works.

       I love the heavy breathing. Also, Ringo plays more than drums on this. He also is credited with bongos and the piano.

       [[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/05/how-the-beatles-wrote-a-day-in-the-life/527001/][Article 1]] - "Liking songs is risky. They are aural fireflies, and you can get too close and lose them"

     - [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/in-my-life/][In My Life]]

       A tour of Liverpool/home. I dunno if this necessarily fills the above criteria. Nothing really stood out on this as super revolutionary in reading about the history of the song.

     - [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/yesterday/][Yesterday]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-yesterday-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterday_(Beatles_song)][Wikipedia]]

       I like the story of how the melody here came to Paul, in a dream. A far more interesting backstory.
       Defnitely starts meloncholic, doesn't necessarily walk you through different feelings after, though.

     - [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/because/][Because]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-because-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Because_(Beatles_song)][Wikipedia]]

       This song seems too simple, emotionally.

     - [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/i-want-to-hold-your-hand/][I Want To Hold Your Hand]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-i-want-to-hold-your-hand-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_to_Hold_Your_Hand][Wikipedia]]

       Not much of a meloncholic start, if you ask me.

     - Penny Lane [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/penny-lane/][Beatles Bible]]

       Not much of a meloncholic start nor does this seem to demonstrate any pioneering.

     - [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/lucy-in-the-sky-with-diamonds/][Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds]], [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/lucy-in-the-sky-with-diamonds/][Genius]],  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_in_the_Sky_with_Diamonds][Wikipedia]]

       No meloncholic start.

     - [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/tomorrow-never-knows/][Tomorrow Never Knows]]

       No meloncholic start.
