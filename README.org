#+EMAIL:  jlewallen@gmail.commit

This repository has my notes and tools for disecting the beatles discography to help me find a friend's top 3 songs.

* Resources

 - [[http://web.mit.edu/scholvin/www/harrison/hbeatles.htm][Songs By George Harrison]]

* 1. Very random.

  - Not on Revolver
  - Not on White
  - Not on Sgt. Pepper's ("They are all in different albums anyways.")
  - There are 3 versions of this song, minimum.
  - Similar style to I Me Mine, slightly more cheerful. [[http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/imm.shtml][Alex W. Pollack]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Me_Mine][Wikipedia]], [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/i-me-mine/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-i-me-mine-lyrics][Genius]]
  - Deep weird emotion.
  - Puts it on and /floats/.
  - Interesting lyrics, debate over meaning and interpreting.
  - Songs with talking/discussions about the music.
  - Newer song.
  - Ringo Talks
  - Not overproduced, raw.
  - I Me Mine is about frustration, drama.

**** Candidates

      - *Dig A Pony* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/dig-a-pony/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-dig-a-pony-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_a_Pony][Wikipedia]], [[http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/dap.shtml][Alex W. Pollack]]

        Ringo speaks in the beginning. Anthology version has talking after the
        song. Stylisticly checks out. Lyrically interesting. It's got parts with
        waltz timing just like I Me Mine. It's a raw sound, having been recorded
        on top of Apple Studios on January 30th.

**** Wrong Choices
     - *The Fool On The Hill* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/the-fool-on-the-hill/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-the-fool-on-the-hill-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fool_on_the_Hill][Wikipedia]]

       *I think this is the one. The only thing is the lyrics don't have as much
       debate as I expected. I'm hoping the debate over who the fool actually is
       turns out to be enough.*

       [[https://scholarsandrogues.com/2017/02/19/the-fool-on-the-hill-mccartneys-ode-to-differentness/][Article 2]]

       Fail! Not at all like I Me Mine.

     - *Within You Without You* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/within-you-without-you/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-within-you-without-you-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Within_You_Without_You][Wikipedia]]

       Fail! Not at all like I Me Mine.

     - *Here Comes The Sun*, *Across the Universe*, *Come Together*, *Hey Jude*, *Let It Be*, *Strawberry Fields*, *Something*, *Norwegian Wood*, *Eleanor Rigby*

**** Excluded

     - *It's All Too Much*

       Too few recordings

     - *Because*, *Yesterday*

       No drums. Popular.

     - *Happiness Is A Warm Gun* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/happiness-is-a-warm-gun/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness_Is_a_Warm_Gun][Wikipedia]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-happiness-is-a-warm-gun-lyrics][Genius]] (Album)
     - *Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/lucy-in-the-sky-with-diamonds/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/lucy-in-the-sky-with-diamonds/][Genius]],  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_in_the_Sky_with_Diamonds][Wikipedia]]
     - *Yesterday*, *Because*, *The Long And Winding Road*, *Get Back*
      
       Too popular.

     - *Two Of Us*, *The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill*, *She's Leaving Home* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/shes-leaving-home/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-shes-leaving-home-lyrics][Genius,]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She%27s_Leaving_Home][Wikipedia]]

       Not the right vibe or like I Me Mine enough.

     - *Lovely Rita*, *From Me To You*, *Getting Better*, *Polythene Pam*, *I've Got A Feeling*, *I'm Looking Through You*, *Oh! Darling*, *Ticket To Ride*, *Things We Said Today*, *Love Me Do*, *Penny Lane*, *Please Please Me*, *Hello, Goodbye*, *I Want To Hold Your Hand*, *One After 909*, *Sgt. Pepper's*, *Dizzy Miss Lizzy*, *Honey Don't*, *A Hard Day's Night*, *All My Loving*, *Fixing A Hole*, *I'll Get You*, *With A Little Help From My Friends*, *I Feel Fine*, *Good Morning Good Morning*, *From Me To You*, *No Reply*, *All My Loving*, *Help!*, *I'll Be Back*, *Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby*, *Get Back*, *Can't Buy Me Love*, *A Hard Day's Night*, *For You Blue*, *You Really Got A Hold On Me*, *And I Love Her*, *Cry Baby Cry*

       Not the right vibe.

**** Seth Conversation Considerations

     - *She Loves You* (No Ringo talking)
     - *Yellow Submarine* (Ringo talks, stylisticly off)
     - *Things We Said Today* (Not very stylisticly like I Me Mine)
     - *Helter Skelter* (White Album)
     - *Golden Slumbers*, *Sun King*, *It's Only Love*, *Girl* (Too few recordings)
     - *I've Got A Feeling*
     - *Two Of Us*
     - *The Night Before*

* 2. ✓ A Day In The Life

  - [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/a-day-in-the-life/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-a-day-in-the-life-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Day_in_the_Life][Wikipedia]]
  - Insanely Popular.
  - Would appear on any "Best Beatles Songs"
  - Is a masterpiece.
  - Meloncholic moments and then walks through different feelings.
  - Story behind the song solidified the favorite position.
  - A song that demonstrated how well ahead of their time they were.
  - Very early discovery.
  - Best of Ringo, subtle and perfect.

**** Candidates

     - *A Day In The Life* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/a-day-in-the-life/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-a-day-in-the-life-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Day_in_the_Life][Wikipedia]]

       My favorite so far. Obviously very influential and demonstrates their pioneering. Very famous and *some* emotional diversity, lyrically. I think the majority of the emotional range comes from the music, which works.

       I love the heavy breathing. Also, Ringo plays more than drums on this. He also is credited with bongos and the piano.

       [[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/05/how-the-beatles-wrote-a-day-in-the-life/527001/][Article 1]] - "Liking songs is risky. They are aural fireflies, and you can get too close and lose them"

       [[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/beatles-a-day-in-the-life-10-things-you-didnt-know-191427/][Article 2]]

     - *In My Life* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/in-my-life/][Beatles Bible]]

       A tour of Liverpool/home. I dunno if this necessarily fills the above criteria. Nothing really stood out on this as super revolutionary in reading about the history of the song.

     - *Yesterday* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/yesterday/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-yesterday-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterday_(Beatles_song)][Wikipedia]]

       I like the story of how the melody here came to Paul, in a dream. A far more interesting backstory.
       Defnitely starts meloncholic, doesn't necessarily walk you through different feelings after, though.

     - *Because* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/because/][Because]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-because-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Because_(Beatles_song)][Wikipedia]]

       This song seems too simple, emotionally.

     - *I Want To Hold Your Hand* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/i-want-to-hold-your-hand/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-i-want-to-hold-your-hand-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_to_Hold_Your_Hand][Wikipedia]]

       Not much of a meloncholic start, if you ask me.

     - *Penny Lane* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/penny-lane/][Beatles Bible]]

       Not much of a meloncholic start nor does this seem to demonstrate any pioneering.

     - *Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/lucy-in-the-sky-with-diamonds/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/lucy-in-the-sky-with-diamonds/][Genius]],  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_in_the_Sky_with_Diamonds][Wikipedia]]

       No meloncholic start.

     - *Tomorrow Never Knows* [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/tomorrow-never-knows/][Beatles Bible]]

       No meloncholic start.
      
**** Wrong Choices

     - *Here Comes The Sun*, *Across the Universe*, *Come Together*, *Hey Jude*, *Let It Be*, *Strawberry Fields*, *Something*

**** Excluded

     - *Day Tripper* (Too few recordings)

* 3. ✓ Something - Anthology 3

  - [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/something/][Beatles Bible]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-something-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_(Beatles_song)][Wikipedia]]

    I got lucky with this one and guessed Something for #2 and she felt
    obligated to reveal I was on track for #3. Thankfully, there's only one
    alternate recording that really works.

**** Candidates

    - *Come Together* (Anthology 3 - "laughy, giggly one")
    - *Helter Skelter* (Take 2 - "Doors-ish")
    - *Strawberry Fields* (No candidates)

* 4. ✓ While My Guitar Gently Weeps
