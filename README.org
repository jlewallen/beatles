   [[https://open.spotify.com/user/jlewalle/playlist/1n119hyulDCJ5qzIObsWf9?si=3rbDltpZS8SGDAzV4TdUxQ][Spotify]]

      My favorite so far. Obviously very influential and demonstrates their pioneering. Very famous and *some* emotional diversity, lyrically. I think the majority of the emotional range comes from the music, which works.

      I love the heavy breathing. Also, Ringo plays more than drums on this. He also is credited with bongos and the piano.

      [[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/05/how-the-beatles-wrote-a-day-in-the-life/527001/][Article 1]] - "Liking songs is risky. They are aural fireflies, and you can get too close and lose them"

    - [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/in-my-life/][In My Life]]

      A tour of Liverpool/home. I dunno if this necessarily fills the above criteria. Nothing really stood out on this as super revolutionary in reading about the history of the song.

    - [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/yesterday/][Yesterday]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-yesterday-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterday_(Beatles_song)][Wikipedia]]

      I like the story of how the melody here came to Paul, in a dream. A far more interesting backstory.
      Defnitely starts meloncholic, doesn't necessarily walk you through different feelings after, though.

    - [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/because/][Because]], [[https://genius.com/The-beatles-because-lyrics][Genius]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Because_(Beatles_song)][Wikipedia]]

      This song seems too simple, emotionally.

      Not much of a meloncholic start, if you ask me.

    - Penny Lane [[https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/penny-lane/][Beatles Bible]]

      Not much of a meloncholic start nor does this seem to demonstrate any pioneering.

      No meloncholic start.

      No meloncholic start.
